                <p>The first step in repairing and maintaining any controller is to know what the parts of the controller are and what they do. 
                   The GameCube controller is pretty simple when you take it apart and see how little there is that really goes into it.
                   I will go through the parts from the outside of the controller to the inside.</p>

                   </ul>
                <p>There are some who like to break the controller down further into the individual components that make up the Joystick housings
                     because their individual components are repairable and or replaceable. For our purposes, we will not be getting into those 
                     components because the Joystick housings are cheap and easy enough to find that the extra work that goes into rebuilding them seems excessive.</p>

                <header>Tools</header>
                 <p>There aren’t a whole lot of tools that you need to take apart and repair a GameCube controller some are very easy and straightforward to use.
                    A tri-wing for example screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the shell together and sandwich the rest of the components to the main circuit board.
                    Where other tools like a soldering iron require a little bit of knowledge and practice like before one would feel comfortable using them. 
                    If you are going to buy a soldering iron for repairs to a GameCube controller or any electronics you definitely want an iron with temperature control
                    settings at the bare minimum. The rest of the tools don’t have to be anything special or fancy to get the job done.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tri-wing screwdriver</li>
                        <li>Soldering iron with temperature control</li>
                        <li>Solder</li>
                        <li>Desoldering pump</li>
                        <li>Steel wool </li>
                        <li>Flux</li>
                        <li>Plastic pry tool</li>
                        <li>Nintendo Switch (or any other Nintendo console capable of connecting with a GameCube controller) </li>
                        <li>Game that uses GameCube controller as an input (Super Smash Brothers Ultimate)</li>
                        <li>Replacement parts (if needed)</li>
                        <li>90% or higher isopropyl alcohol</li>
                        <li>Q-tips</li>
                        <li>Paper towels</li>
                        <li>Thin stiff brush </li>
                        <li>Magnifying glass with a built in light (optional)</li>
                        <li>Soldering station with clamp arms (optional)</li>
                    </ul>

                 <p>Most of these tools are self-explanatory in what they are used for but if one is inexperienced in electronics repair some of these may raise questions.
                    Steel wool is used to clean off the tip of the hot soldering iron in between soldering components. The isopropyl alcohol is for cleaning because
                    it evaporates rapidly leaving no residue on the electrically sensitive components and boards. Q-tips, paper towels, and the brush are for clearing
                    dust and cleaning. The optional tools will just make working on the smaller components easier.</p>

                <header>Trouble Shooting</header>
                 <p>To begin the process of troubleshooting it’s always best to ask the owner of the controller what the issue is that they are experiencing. 
                    These issues can range from the rubber on the control sticks being worn off, various buttons and trigger not responding or feel right, 
                    the control sticks are not registering the correct inputs, or the cable can be damaged which would lead to no inputs registering.
                    After asking what the issue is it’s best to take a look at it yourself both visually and in trying to use the controller if it is responding at all.<br><br>
                    <code> visually inspect for damage → feel the way the controller responds to inputs → connect with console and see how a game reacts to inputs </code></p>
                 
                 <p>After taking these steps you should have an idea of what is potentially wrong with the controller if the rubber is failing on the control 
                    stick then the control stick will need to be replaced. If the control stick is outputting bad inputs or inputs automatically the joystick
                    housing will need to be replaced. If buttons aren’t responding or are sticking they will likely be functional after cleaning or a replacement
                    of the button contact pad. If the triggers aren’t responding then it is likely that the contact simply moved out of its seat.
                    If the cable is damaged it will likely need to be replaced. The controller will need to be opened up to repair any of these issues where we will do an
                    inspection to diagnose the issue further. </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Repair">
                <header>Repair</header>
                 <p>The repair process is fairly straightforward as not too many things fail on a GameCube controller short of the joystick housings and the rubber
                    on the control stick. It is usually the left control stick housing as well rather than the C-stick housing due to it being the most used 
                    component of the controller. That being said we will cover the most common repairs in this manual. Follow these steps to open the controller <br><br>

                    <code> remove 6 tri-wing screws from the bottom of the shell → gently pry apart the two halves of the shell with the top half facing down to avoid
                    dropping the buttons → remove the button and directional pads from the top half of the shell → remove buttons from the top half of the shell → 
                    gently free the cable from the bottom housing → lift the main circuit board and the C-stick circuit board </code></p>

                 <p>From here we will begin the repair process starting with the most common repair being the rubber on the control stick failing. <br><br>

                    <code> pull the damaged control stick off of the joystick housing → inspect joystick housing for any debris, if there is any debris dust it off 
                    with the small brush → place a new control stick on the joystick housing making sure to align the guide on the control stick with the one on
                    the housing → reverse steps you took to open controller to close it back up </code><br><br>

                    Next, we will go through the steps of replacing the joystick housing. You can tell that these need to be replaced when the control stick is
                    loose when you touch it. The joystick housing will also need to be replaced if the controller is not giving you the correct inputs or automatic
                    inputs. This is caused by wear and tear on the plastic components of the joystick housing. <br><br> </p>

                 <p>If the controller you are repairing is an older model you will follow this instruction set to replace the joystick housing. <br><br>

                    <code> Flip the circuit boards → locate the solder joints that hold the joystick housing to the circuit board (there are six solder joints)
                    → use a soldering iron to desolder the joints along with a desoldering pump to collect the solder → remove the broken joystick housing
                    → install new joystick housing → apply flux to the circuit board → heat and apply new solder to the circuit board to make new solder
                    joints → reverse steps you took to open controller to close it back up </code><br><br>

                    If the controller you are repairing is a newer model you will follow this instruction set to replace the joystick housing.<br><br>

                    <code>Flip the circuit boards → locate the two screws that hold the joystick housing to the circuit board (there are two screws) 
                        → use a screwdriver to remove the screws → remove the broken joystick housing → install the new joystick housing → 
                        reinstall the screws → reverse steps you took to open controller to close it back up </code><br><br>

                <header>Testing</header>
                <p>The process of testing your repair is basically the same as when you were troubleshooting to find the issue. Once the controller is back 
                    together you should test the input first by touch making sure it feels right. If doing the input feels right the next step is to plug it 
                    into your console of choice and to test it out in a game. If the input showing up on the screen is the same as the one that you entered
                     then you know that your repair was done correctly. It is good to stress test the controller for a little while so you know it will work 
                     for an extended period of time and that it was a high-quality repair. </p>
